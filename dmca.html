    <h1>DMCA Policy</h1>
    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) is designed to protect content creators from having their work stolen and published by other people on the internet.</p>

    <p>The law specifically targets websites where owners do not know who contributed each item of content or that the website is a platform for uploading and publishing content.</p>

    <p>We have the policy to respond to any infringement notice and take appropriate action.</p>

    <p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy applies to the <a href="https://www.snapth.art/">snapth</a> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”) and outlines how this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”) addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you (“you” or “your”) may submit a copyright infringement complaint.</p>

    <p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same.</p>

    <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
    <p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>

    <p>If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.</p>

    <p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user.</p>
